(File structure is that of a Codepen)

Through this challenge I created a Tic Tac Toe game.

User stories that are challenge requirements:
 
**User Story**: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer

**User Story**: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again..

**User Story**: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
