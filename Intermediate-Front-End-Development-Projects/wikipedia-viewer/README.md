freeCodeCamp Wiki search
-------------------------

Through this challenge I created a search page for wiki articles.

You can either ask for certain articles based on your searching or ask for a random one.

Here is a preview..

And of course API is through wikipedia .

You can the wiki search live in [Codepen](https://codepen.io/GeorgeLin/pen/ZyWrOW).

Keep coding,
