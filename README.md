freeCodeCamp Challenges
-----------------------

This repository contains my solutions for freeCodeCamps algorithms.

I uploaded them in order to monitor my progress and of course be able to search for them if needed.


Please feel free to take a look but take into consideration the fact that these solutions

are not the only ones for each algorithm.


As always in coding and in every problem in life, there is never only one solution!


Keep coding,

George
